# thyroid-cancer-classification
This project analyzes thyroid disease data using PCA and Kernel PCA for dimensionality reduction, combined with classifiers like Naive Bayes, KNN, LDA, and a custom Kernel Discriminant Analysis. It compares different kernel functions and visualizes accuracy across varying components to optimize classification performance.
